# Stargazers Viewer

# Request:
Create a simple mobile app, using the React Native framework, that, through the GitHub API, allows you to view the list of stargazers in a repository (the list of users who have added it to their favorites). The app must allow the user to type the owner and name of the repository and must therefore show the list (including avatar and username) of the users who have added it to their favorites

## Note
Only basic components of ReactNeative were used for development.

For the navigation was used the react-navigation package

In the Home view, for the query construction was used a logic that allows to search by owner, name of the repository or both.
